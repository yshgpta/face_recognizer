# Face Recognizer
This app is used to detect the facial location of a person in a image. For this you have to paste the online link of the image.</br>
This app will then detect the face and will predict the gender, region and age. Don't be sad if it judges you older than you are :) </br>
To use this app you first have to register yourself and then you can sign-in easily by providing your valid credentials<br/>
I have used the Clarify Api for face detection which uses the machine learning algorithm to provide us the predicted information.</br>

Following is the overview of the app...
